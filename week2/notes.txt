Classes:

Four pillars of OOP:
    Encapsulation: Specific data can be restricted from the rest of your code.
    Abstraction: Logic and complexity is hidden for simplicity
    Inheritance: Sharing of similar features and attrs
    Polymorphism: Objects can take different forms depending on their needs
